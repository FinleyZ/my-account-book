# My-Account-Book App
A simple bookkeeping app for the software design course ECE 5010

The project is a desktop-based cross-platform application for personal bookkeeping. It has typical bookkeeping functionalities with data visualization capabilities.
Some functionalities include recording a user’s transactions, adding input and output streams, visualizing personal finances in charts and graphs per duration, filtering transactions by category, calculating spending averages based on duration, viewing debit and credit information, and comparing financial information between two periods.

# Required Software

The following are dependencies to install or have installed on your machine to run the application:

## Npm and Node.js (installed together)

Install through this [link:] (https://nodejs.org/en/).

## React

Unzip the project folder and change the working directory as the project’s directory
Install React as a dependency for this project locally by writing this command:
`npm install react-scripts`

**Note:** You should not install react as a global Node.js module because it can interfere with other Node.js projects you might have on your machine.

# Getting Started with My-Account-Book App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Before start the app, you may need install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.\
By default, npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
